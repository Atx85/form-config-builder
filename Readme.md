Problem:
If there are many forms with lots of fields there is an advantage in seperating the form into modular form field views and a config that helps to combine the fields in whatever way they are required, however, when there are many changes required in the config, it is easier to do them using UI, instead of retyping them.

Possible solution:
Creating a simple frontend that can accomodate form config updates.
